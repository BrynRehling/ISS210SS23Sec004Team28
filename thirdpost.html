                        <p>It is a mistake to assume that men and women experience illnesses and react to medicine the same way. Anatomy and physiology differ between genders, which can affect how diseases manifest and how the body responds to treatment. Women are more likely than men to experience adverse reactions to certain medications, such as painkillers and sedatives, due to differences in body size, hormone levels, and liver function. Women may also experience different symptoms than men for certain conditions which can lead to misdiagnosis and delayed treatment.</p>
                        <p>In many societies, there are specific expectations and behaviors that are associated with masculinity and femininity. These gender norms can influence health behaviors, such as diet, exercise, and substance use, as well as access to and utilization of healthcare services. For men, traditional gender norms that emphasize toughness, self-reliance, and risk-taking may discourage them from seeking help for physical or mental health problems. For women, gender norms that prioritize caregiving responsibilities and downplay the importance of self-care may lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment for health problems. It is important to recognize and address these gender disparities in healthcare in order to improve overall health outcomes based on gender.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Addressing Gender Disparities in Medical Research and Healthcare for Improved Patient Outcomes</h2>
                        <p>Unfortunately, it was not until the early 1990s that women were routinely included in clinical trials, and even today, women remain underrepresented in medical research. Insufficient research on women means that the medications they are taking today may still not have been developed with them in mind. To create a more inclusive healthcare system, it is important to conduct more research and clinical trials on women's diseases and responses. This can be achieved by ensuring that women are adequately represented as both healthcare decision-makers and authors of medical research. By prioritizing gender diversity in healthcare research and leadership, we can develop a more comprehensive understanding of women's health needs and ultimately improve the quality of care for all patients.</p>
                        <p>This means your headings should not say second heading.</p>
                        <h2 class="section-heading">Third heading</h2>
                        <p>Each blog post should include an image and a pdf or a video. Included in the following lines is the code for including an image. In the link below, include your pdf. The image is the source, labeled src below. You simply have to follow the directory path to replace the image. The directory path as is is stating you will find this image if you go to assets, then image, and there you will find the image I have called. This must be the exact path. Changing punctutation or capitalization will mean the site cannot find your picture. Remember, machines are incredibly literal.</p>
                        <a href="#!"><img class="img-fluid" src="assets/img/handstoheart.jpeg" alt="..." /></a>
                        <span class="caption text-muted">This is how you add captions under an image. Cite your image here. You may also say something about it, if you like.</span>
                        <p>Just like a quote, you should not leave an image resting there. Say something about what the image does for your site.</p>
                        <p>Finally, you may also include a video. Not every member has to do all three. Choose whether you want a video to cite and unpack or a PDF. If it is a video, you only need to include the video and information about it (your summary). If it is a PDF, you should include a picture.</p>
