                        <p>Over the past 20 years, the lack of effective care for women around the world has surfaced to the public eye. In our society, it is perceived that men receive high quality care whereas women must settle for the bare minimum. Many researchers and advocates have pointed out the fact that most medical research is done on men, adding further bias the treatment/diagnosis given. </p>
                        <p>The issue that needs to be addressed is how we can improve the quality of health care for women.  It has been shown that men receive faster and more affective care compared to females. More than 20 years of research from high-income, middle in- come and low-income countries shows that gender in- equalities remain embedded in health systems to this day.</p>
                        <p>Many implications have been added to the healthcare scene to help eliminate the gender-bias at hand. There is some empirical evidence showing how to narrow the gender gaps in healthcare, as the reviewed literature reveals that that most of the interventions were successful at achieving at least one of the expected outcomes. Nevertheless, it is alarming that studies of interventions in primary healthcare, where the impact of narrowing of gender bias could be greater, are almost absent in the present available research.</p>

                        <p>Cardiovascular disease is one of the most undiagnosed and untreated diseases among women. Many studies have addressed gender bias in clinical practice, particularly in cardiovascular disease. In concordance with this, cardio- vascular health was the predominant issue addressed in the analyzed interventions. Although cardiovascular disease is most common, gender bias has been described in the clinical practice by a great number of diseases, so it is necessary to expand the field of work to other health issues as well.</p>

                        <p>Women receive treatment and diagnosis that is based off research done on men. It has been shown that women are almost always diagnosed with cardiovascular disease later than men. The picture below shows how healthcare is effective when itâ€™s directed toward men and how it can cause challenges when it comes to women. This picture shows how healthcare is perceived by most women due to lack of consideration when it comes to giving effective diagnosis and treatment.</p>
