                        <p>Women in our country today face a lot of sexism especially inside of Healthcare. Over the years, women have had more chronic conditions, functional limitations, depression, and disability when compared to me. Also maternal mortality has increased in the United States over the last few decades. This is definitely a problem because a higher maternal mortality rate could actually drastically affect the population in the country if it gets too high. On top of this, women have to face more barriers when it comes to accessing healthcare which is an issue because women are more likely to need healthcare services for reproductive care and chronic conditions than men. It has also been established that a lack of power in healthcare institutions adds to the barrier that women face. These are both indirect and direct reasons like for example underrepresentation in political decision-making regarding health care and other access barriers that restrict women’s reproductive choices.</p>

                        <h2 class="section-heading">Here are the facts</h2>
                        <p>Even when getting treated, women still face sexism and do not get the same treatment as men. For example, 10% of women report having a limited choice when it came to care while just 5% of men said the same thing. Women are also more likely to report that their provider did not spend enough time with them during their last visit than men. These are just some of the few barriers women have to face but there are plenty more when it comes to healthcare in this country..</p>

                        <p>Each blog post should include an image and a PDF or a video. Included in the following lines is the code for including an image and a PDF. In the link below, include your pdf. The image is the source, labeled src below. You simply have to follow the directory path to replace the image. The directory path as is is stating you will find this image if you go to assets, then image, and there you will find the image I have called. This must be the exact path. Changing punctutation or capitalization will mean the site cannot find your picture. Remember, machines are incredibly literal.</p>

                        <p>The graph shows the percentage of women who skipped medical tests or treatment because of the cost compared to men. 20% of women in the last year have skipped medical treatment compared to 15% of men. 17% of women have also skipped doses of medicine because they couldn’t afford it compared to 12% of men. Despite these numbers in 2018 only 11% of women were uninsured compared to 14% of men. This means even though less women are uninsured, the ones who are are less likely to get the proper medical care compared to the men who are uninsured.</p>
